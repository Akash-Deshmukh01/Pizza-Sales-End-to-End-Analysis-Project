# Pizza-Sales-End-to-End-Analysis-Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive end-to-end business analysis project based on pizza sales data. The objective was to derive actionable insights and build dynamic reports and dashboards to support data-driven decision-making for a pizza chain. The project follows the full data analysis lifecycle â€” from data extraction and transformation (ETL) to visualization and insight generation.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used
SQL
Performed data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). Cleaned raw sales data, handled missing values, optimized table structures, and ran key business queries using joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.

Excel
Used Power Query to clean and transform data. Built an interactive dashboard using pivot tables, slicers, and advanced Excel formulas (like INDEX, MATCH, IF, and SUMIFS) to summarize daily/weekly/monthly sales, top-selling pizzas, and customer trends.

Power BI
Created interactive dashboards using various DAX functions (e.g., CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, DATESYTD) to track metrics like total revenue, average order value, best-selling categories, hourly trends, and seasonal performance.

Tableau
Developed a polished visual report to represent pizza sales across time, product categories, and customer behavior using intuitive charts, filters, and drill-down features.
